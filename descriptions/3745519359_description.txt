In order to create a pool of qualified applicants, Sierra College accepts applications in all subject areas and conducts interviews for teaching positions throughout the year. Applications are kept in the hiring pool for a period of two years. The number of open positions varies from semester to semester. The Division Dean or Department Chair will contact you directly for an interview when a position becomes available. We appreciate your interest in Sierra College!
