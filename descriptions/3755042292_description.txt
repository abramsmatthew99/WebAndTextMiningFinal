CS is a critical part of the newly formed School of Computer and Data Science (SCDS) and is anticipating a major growth in tenure-track and career faculty members. The department aims to be a pioneering hub for advancing education and research, fostering collaborations, and forging connections across disciplines, the university, and the global community. We are dedicated to attracting a diverse community of students and scholars who collaborate effectively with one another and with societal partners to make a positive impact on the world. We empower our students to become interdisciplinary problem solvers, innovators, and entrepreneurs. Our department is committed to cultivating a friendly, inclusive, and welcoming environment and seeks colleagues who share these values. CS faculty members play a foundational role at the University of Oregon, engaging in fundamental research and providing crucial support to other departments, disciplines, and the new Knight Campus. Our CS faculty actively participate in core CS research and an increasing number of interdisciplinary research collaborations in the areas of networking, distributed systems, data science, high-performance computing, cybersecurity, and programming languages, all guided by ethical principles, technological adaptability, and societal needs. Furthermore, they have played a significant role in the development and support of SCDS. Moreover, our faculty members have established five world-class research centers including the Oregon Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (OCCoE), the Oregon Advanced Computing Institute for Science and Society (OACISS), the Center for Cyber Security and Privacy (CCSP), the Center for Big Learning (CBL), and the Center for Digital Mental Health.
