Part-time faculty teach one or more courses as part of the MS CS and MS DS degree programs at the Roux Institute. Courses are 14-weeks long, with fall, spring, and summer terms beginning in September, January, and May, respectively. Each course normally meets for 3 hours and 20 minutes once per week, often in the evening to support working students. Other meeting schedules are possible. Faculty are expected to teach in-person while also supporting remote learners. Teaching synchronously online may also be possible. We are searching across allareas of computer science and data science.
