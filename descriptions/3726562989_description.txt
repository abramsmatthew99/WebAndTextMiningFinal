St. Paul’s School announces a search for the position of Computer Science teacher to begin duties in late August 2024. The primary responsibility of the teacher will be to teach computer science. After recently redesigning our computer science curriculum, we are seeking a person to teach courses in Arduino C and physical computing, combining computer science with the resources in our maker’s space. The teacher will teach several courses in computer science, with the possibility of also teaching robotics, engineering, and/or physics while serving as the point person for the computer science program. Preference will be given to candidates with experience running a computer science program at the secondary or college level. Likewise, robotics, engineering, physics experience, and familiarity with robotics competitions are valued.
