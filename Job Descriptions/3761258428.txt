Charitable Contribution MatchingCOUNTERPART'S VALUESConjoin Expectations - it is the cornerstone of autonomy. Ensure you are aware of what is expected of you and clearly articulate what you expect of others. Speak Boldly & Honestly - the only failure is not learning from mistakes. Don't cheat yourself and your colleagues of the feedback needed when expectations aren't being met. Be Entrepreneurial - control your own destiny. Embrace action over perfection while navigating any obstacles that stand in the way of your ultimate goal. Practice Omotenashi ("selfless hospitality") - trust will follow. Consider every interaction with internal and external partners an opportunity to develop trust by going above and beyond what is expected. Hold Nothing As Sacred - create routines but modify them routinely. Take the time to reflect on where the business is today, where it needs to go, and what you have to change in order to get there. Prioritize Wellness - some things should never be sacrificed. We create an environment that stretches everyone to grow and improve, which is fulfilling, but is only one part of a meaningful life. We are committed to being a welcoming and inclusive workplace for everyone, and we are intentional about making sure people feel respected, supported and connected at workâ€”regardless of who you are or where you come from. We value and celebrate our differences and we believe being open about who we are allows us to do the best work of our lives.We are an Equal Opportunity Employer.
