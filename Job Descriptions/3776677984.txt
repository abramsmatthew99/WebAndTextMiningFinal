<strong>Summary<br/><br/></strong><strong> Job Summary <br/><br/></strong>PREP Research Associate to develop radio frequency (RF) and microwave field strength sensors. This includes continuous wave and modulated fields. The associate will work with anechoic chambers, transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cells, vector network analyzers, power amplifiers, oscilloscopes, and other RF equipment. This work will include researching novel field strength probes for low fields and modulated fields. Tasks include carrying out calibrations of RF equipment, performing uncertainty analysis, and automating data acquisition. The associate will bring experience in troubleshooting RF electronics and will strengthen their understanding of metrology and knowledge of fundamental radio frequency measurements.<br/><br/>This position is part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Professional Research Experience Program (PREP). NIST recognizes that its research staff may wish to collaborate with researchers at academic institutions on specific projects of mutual interest, thus requires that such institutions must be the recipient of a PREP award. The PREP program requires staff from a wide range of backgrounds to work on scientific research in many areas. Employees in this position will perform technical work that underpins the scientific research of the collaboration.<br/><br/>The University of Colorado Boulder is committed to building a culturally diverse community of faculty, staff, and students dedicated to contributing to an inclusive campus environment. We are an Equal Opportunity employer, including veterans and individuals with disabilities.<br/><br/><strong>Who We Are<br/><br/></strong>PREP is a special partnership between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Colorado Boulder. PREP provides research opportunities to CU undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers with a Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD in NIST labs to gain research experience alongside NIST scientists.<br/><br/>The particular group that needs a researcher is the Electromagnetics Field Group under the RF Technology Division at NIST.<br/><br/><strong>Responsibilities<br/><br/></strong><strong> What Your Key Responsibilities Will Be <br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Develop calibration methods for modulated signals.</li><li>Calibrate, repair, and troubleshoot RF equipment.</li><li>Perform fundamental research into modulated microwave field strength measurements.</li><li>Automate data acquisition in anechoic chambers and TEM cells using positioners, rotation stages, and robotic arms.</li><li>Perform uncertainty analysis on calibrations and field strength measurements.</li><li>Keep a well-maintained log of experimental activities.</li><li>Disseminate research through peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and other presentations.</li><li>Work collaboratively with an interdisciplinary team.<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>What You Should Know<br/><br/></strong><strong>Privacy Act Statement<br/><br/></strong>Authority: 15 U.S.C.<br/><br/><ul><li>278g-1(e)(1) and (e)(3) and 15 U.S.C.</li><li>272(b) and (c)<br/><br/></li></ul>Purpose: The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) hosts the Professional Research Experience Program (PREP) which is designed to provide valuable laboratory experience and financial assistance to undergraduates, post-bachelor’s degree holders, graduate students, master’s degree holders, postdocs, and faculty.<br/><br/>PREP is a 5-year cooperative agreement between NIST laboratories and participating PREP Universities to establish a collaborative research relationship between NIST and U.S. institutions of higher education in the following disciplines including (but may not be limited to) biochemistry, biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, engineering, electronics, materials science, mathematics, nanoscale science, neutron science, physical science, physics, and statistics.
