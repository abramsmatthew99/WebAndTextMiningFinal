As our engineering R&amp;D services expanded, we later sharpened our focus on applications and technology related to mobile robotics, sensing and perception, autonomy, and simulation. In 2019 we became Quantum Signal AI, a subsidiary of Ford Motor developing technologies to advance their R&amp;D efforts. We build solutions to enhance the capability, robustness, safety, and acceptance of intelligent ground vehicles and mobile robotics all in an effort to make transportation more effective and efficient for all.<br/><br/>Our HQ in the historic Union School in Saline, MI is the perfect playground to develop this cutting-edge technology and we’re always looking for smart folks who like new challenges, learning new skills, and technical variety.<br/><br/>Powered by JazzHR<br/><br/>M34DAj10mG
