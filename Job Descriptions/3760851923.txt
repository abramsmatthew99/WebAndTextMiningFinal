Founded by scholar and teacher John A. Browning, The Browning School has been a leader in fostering the intellectual and personal growth of boys and young men since 1888.

When a boy’s capacities and aspirations are known and understood by his teachers, that boy can be guided, year after year, to take increasing ownership of his learning. He will develop the disposition not only to respond to others’ questions, but also the ability to craft questions of his own, questions that will drive his class’s process of inquiry. Through this activity, the boys are likewise challenged to ask similar searching questions of themselves. It is through this questioning that they come to understand their identities as intellectual and moral agents, and recognize the opportunities they have to develop and refine their senses of self and character. In reflecting upon the bigger, essential questions that arise from their self-examination and academic work alike, Browning boys are inspired to seek a deeper level of understanding and to build a sense of purpose that will engage their passions and skills in the service of the world beyond themselves.<br/><br/><strong>Position Description<br/><br/></strong>Browning is looking for a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Teacher for the 2023-2024 academic year to teach grades two to nine.
