<strong><strong>Your work days are brighter here.<br/><br/></strong></strong>At Workday, it all began with a conversation over breakfast.

And ever since, the happiness, development, and contribution of every Workmate is central to who we are.

Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply <strong>spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field</strong> with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote "home office" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.<br/><br/><strong>Workday Pay Transparency Statement<br/><br/></strong>The annualized base salary ranges for the primary location and any additional locations are listed below.
