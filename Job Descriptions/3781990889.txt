        Meta is hiring ASIC Frontend Implementation Engineers within our Infrastructure organization. We are looking for individuals with experience in front-end implementation from RTL to netlist, including RTL Lint, CDC analysis, timing constraints, synthesis to build efficient System on Chip (SoC) and IP for data center applications.<br/><br/>ASIC Engineer, Implementation Responsibilities:<br/><br/><ul><li>Run Logic/Physical Synthesis using advanced optimization techniques and generate optimized Gate Level Netlist for Timing, Area, Power. Debug the timing/area/congestion issues and work with RTL &amp; Physical designers to resolve them.</li><li>Perform Power Estimation at RTL and Gate Level and identify power reduction opportunities.</li><li>Run Formal Verification checks between RTL and Gate level netlist and debug the aborts, inconclusive and Logic Equivalency failures.</li><li>Perform RTL Lint and work with the Designers to create waivers.</li><li>Perform RTL DFT Analysis and improve the DFT coverage for Stuck-at faults.</li><li>Perform Flat and Hierarchical Clock Domain Crossing and work with the designers to analyze the complex clock domain crossings and sign off the CDC.</li><li>Perform Flat and Hierarchical Reset Domain crossing Checks. Understand the Reset-Architecture by working with Design and FW teams and develop reset groups and the corresponding reset sequence for RDC.</li><li>Develop Timing Constraints for RTL-Synthesis and PrimeTime-STA for the blocks and the top-level including SOC. Analyze the inter-block timing and come up with IO budgets for the various partition blocks.</li><li>Developing Automation scripts and Methodology for all FE-tools including (Lint, CDC, RDC, Synthesis, STA, Power).</li><li>Work closely with the Design Engineers, DV Engineers, Emulation Engineers in supporting them with the handoff tasks. Interact with Physical Design Engineers and provide them with timing/congestion feedback.<br/><br/></li></ul>Minimum Qualifications:<br/><br/><ul><li>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, relevant technical field, or equivalent practical experience.</li><li>10+ Years of experience in DFT, Design Integration, and Front-End Implementation.</li><li>Experience with RTL Synthesis and design optimization for Power, Performance, Area.</li><li>Knowledge of front-end and back-end ASIC tools.</li><li>Experience with RTL design using SystemVerilog or other HDL.</li><li>Experience managing multiple design releases and working with cross functional teams to support and debug timing, area, power issues.</li><li>Experience with EDA tools and scripting languages (Python, TCL) used to build tools and flows for complex environments.</li><li>Experience with communicating across functional internal teams and vendors.<br/><br/></li></ul>Preferred Qualifications:<br/><br/><ul><li>Synthesis Background, Timing Constraints Development, Floorplanning and STA.</li><li>Experience Knowledge of RTL coding using Verilog/System Verilog.</li><li>Experience with Timing/physical libraries, SRAM Memories.</li><li>Experience with Power, Performance, Area Analysis and techniques for reducing power.</li><li>Experience with Clock Domain Crossing, Reset Domain Crossing, LEC.</li><li>Experience with Design Compiler, Spyglass, PrimeTime, Formality or equivalent tools.</li><li>Scripting and programming experience using Perl/Python, TCL, and Make.<br/><br/></li></ul>About Meta:<br/><br/>Meta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses.
