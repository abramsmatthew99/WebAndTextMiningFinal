<strong>Duties<br/><br/></strong><strong>Summary<br/><br/></strong>As a Commercial Crew Program (CCP) Ground Command and Control Systems Engineer, you will develop expertise in the launch providers hardware and software systems; how they are developed, designed, tested, and operate. You will apply engineering knowledge and skills to perform technical assessments against requirements, define and develop tools, and identify, define, and communicate elevated risk. These skills will support launches sending astronauts to the International Space Station.<br/><br/><strong>Requirements<br/><br/></strong><strong>Qualifications<br/><br/></strong>In addition to the Basic Education Requirement (in the Education section below), to qualify for this position you must meet the requirements below. Specialized experience is experience that has equipped you with the particular ability, skill, and knowledge to successfully perform the duties of this position and is typically in or related to this line of work. NASA utilizes OPM-approved qualification and rating requirements specific for Aerospace Technology (AST) positions which recognizes NASA's unique aerospace work. The specific qualifications and minimum education requirements are further described below and within the education section of the job announcement. To qualify for GS-07, you must have: a) One year of directly related specialized experience equivalent to the GS-05 level studying or assisting in aerospace related research, development design, operations, or Studying or applying theories, concepts, principles, and/or methodology to assist in the understanding of a system, subsystem, or components; Using a software programing language such as Python; Assisting with the identification of issues for a software program, system, subsystem, or component. OR b) Completed 1 full academic year of graduate study in an appropriate field OR c) Any combination of experience and graduate study in an appropriate field d) You may also qualify at the GS-07 level by meeting one of these Special Provisions: Are in the upper third of your class, based on completed college work at the time of filing an application. Have an average of 2.9 or better on a 4.0 scale for either all completed college work at the time of application, or all college courses completed during the last 2 years of the undergraduate curriculum. Achieved a grade average of B+ (3.5 on a 4.0 scale) or better in the major field of study where such field is fully qualifying. This is either the average of all completed college work in the major field of study at the time of application or the average of all college courses completed in the major field of study during the last 2 years of the undergraduate curriculum. Elected to membership in one of the national honorary scholastic societies meeting the minimum requirements of the Association of College Honor Societies (other than freshman honor societies). These honor societies are listed at ACHS. Completed 12 months of student trainee experience that includes at least one work period equivalent to the GS-5, or at least 15 months of appropriate student trainee experience which includes one work period equivalent to the GS-04 level. One work period is 2 months or 320 hours. For engineering positions, successfully completed a 5-year program of study, or at least 160 semester hours, leading to a bachelor's degree. For engineering positions, have a professional engineering degree, and up to 12 months of experience gained as a technician or technologist equivalent to the GS-5 or higher level. Successfully completed all requirements for two bachelor's degrees, one in an appropriate field of science or engineering. Have six months of directly related/specialized experience or training, including 3 months gained after the junior year of college. This experience may have been obtained on a part-time or intermittent basis and may have been paid or unpaid. Received honors or elective positions indicating superior leadership outside of your academic setting. Additionally, your academic standing must have been in the upper half of the graduating class.
