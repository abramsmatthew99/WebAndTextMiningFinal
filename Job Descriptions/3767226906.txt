<strong>What We Do<br/><br/></strong>Gecko Robotics is helping the world's most important organizations ensure the availability, reliability, and sustainability of critical infrastructure. Gecko's complete and connected solutions combine wall-climbing robots, industry-leading sensors, and an AI-powered data platform to provide customers with a unique window into the current and future health of their physical assets. This enables real-time decision making to increase the efficiency and safety of operations, promote mission readiness, and protect the environment and civilization from the effects of infrastructure failure.<br/><br/><strong>About The Team<br/><br/></strong>Gecko's software teams come into the picture <em>after </em>our robots and operators collect data in the field. The petabytes of data our robots collect are only valuable and useful if we as humans (and our software tools) are able to understand the story the inspections are telling.
