        The CS-Infused OpenSciEd Curriculum Project Manager will report to the Senior Director of Operations and will be responsible for managing and facilitating the work between the development teams at Northwestern University, Stanford University, and Horizon Research Institute who will develop the classroom and professional learning materials, including field testing. Upon completion of each unit’s development process, the Project Manager will oversee the public release of the materials. The Project Manager will also work hand-in-hand with the Senior Director in all aspects of the project, including regular meetings and reporting on commitments with Amazon, building product awareness, fostering partnerships with the science and computer science education communities, and supporting budget, reporting, and contract obligations. Additionally, the Project Manager will be an external face of the project, representing the work in the broader education community.<br/><br/><strong>About The Computer Science (CS) Infused Curriculum Project<br/><br/></strong>In an increasingly digitally connected world, where computer science plays a pivotal role as a driving force in our economy, it is imperative for school districts to guarantee that every student, from the early stages of their K-12 educational journey, has equitable access and opportunities to computer science learning and career exploration. Over the last decade, many states have enacted policies and strategies to expand access to computer science learning in high school, leading to an 18% increase in the number of students taking high school computer science courses. However, disparities in female, Black, and Hispanic/Latino student participation continue, and efforts that solely focus on high school participation are often too late for students to build the interest and academic foundation needed to be college and career-ready in computer science. However, studies indicate that underrepresented students who experience computer science early are more likely to enroll in subsequent computer science courses and are more likely to pursue computer science post-secondary pathways.<br/><br/>This project seeks to ensure all students have an opportunity to learn computer science concepts and skills in grades 6-8 of middle school by developing a comprehensive science and computer science integrated curriculum that serves as a high-quality, core science curriculum. The OpenSciEd CS-infused curriculum project will develop, market, and distribute high-quality, open-source, and freely available project-based integrated curricular units that align with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) Standards.<br/><br/>We will seamlessly incorporate computer science concepts and skills into OpenSciEd’s highly-rated middle school units. These materials have been independently evaluated as high quality by WestEd and EdReports. OpenSciEd’s CS-infused curriculum project seeks to eliminate the traditional barriers to computer science learning that hinder access and a sense of belonging in computer science for students underrepresented in the field and help them see themselves as computer scientists.<br/><br/>This project is generously funded by Amazon through their Future Engineers initiative.<br/><br/><strong>Key responsibilities include but are not limited to:<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Manage the interactions between the project partners, including (but not limited to) teachers, schools, districts, developers, and the funder</li><li>Ensure meaningful data is collected from teachers and schools to inform the redesign</li><li>Participate in decision-making about content and structure for the student and teacher materials, focusing on designing for diverse audiences</li><li>Help define the target audience and ideate on expanding the market for these materials</li><li>Participate in design and decision-making about classroom and teacher professional learning experiences</li><li>Implement management systems to ensure that the project, and all its partners, are progressing on schedule and budget</li><li>Manage the project budget and contracts with all partners</li><li>Oversee the product launch and communication about the new materials</li><li>Contribute to the OpenSciEd.org website<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Requirements<br/><br/></strong><strong>The ideal candidate will have: <br/><br/></strong><ul><li>5+ years of professional experience, which includes a track record of success in state or district educational leadership and/or K-12 curriculum development. </li><li>Strong project management experience, including successfully leading multi-partner initiatives</li><li>Experience working with philanthropic funders and grant reporting requirements</li><li>Strong knowledge of the Next Generation Science Standards</li><li>Strong knowledge of the CSTA Standards</li><li>Robust experience delivering teacher professional learning in science</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, including communicating complex information with clarity to diverse audiences, facilitating dialogue, and building consensus</li><li>Demonstrated commitment to valuing diversity and contributing to an inclusive working and learning environment</li><li>Aptitude for interpersonal rapport building and working collaboratively with others, including the ability to collaborate positively, constructively, and succinctly</li><li>Comfort in working remotely with colleagues and partners in multiple time zones</li><li>Strong knowledge of the OpenSciEd Instructional Model and Professional Learning Principles</li><li>Strategic vision related to the important role of curriculum reform and the widespread implementation of high-quality instructional materials to advance learning. </li><li>Strong knowledge of the state of education reform and savviness about the political realities of various improvement strategies</li><li>Experience working with universities, state education agencies, and/or school districts</li><li>Evidence of an entrepreneurial mindset</li><li>Experience with fiscal management, budgeting, contract development, and oversight</li><li>Ability to thrive in a collaborative and diverse environment</li><li>Advanced degree preferred</li><li>Familiarity with computer science and science education research, entities, and players in K-12 education reform efforts preferred. </li><li>Classroom teaching experience preferred<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Benefits<br/><br/></strong>Compensation is in the range of $120,000-$125,000, with competitive benefits and generous paid time off and paid holidays.
