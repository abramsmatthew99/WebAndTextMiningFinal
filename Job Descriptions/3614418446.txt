<strong><u>Description<br/><br/></u></strong><strong>About the Job<br/><br/></strong>Colorado Christian University is looking for an outstanding teacher who deeply desires to commit his or her skills and energy to transform students to impact the world with grace and truth.

Candidates with a Master’s degree and substantial relevant professional experience may be considered as well. CCU values a practitioner/scholar model in which its faculty members are actively engaged in their professions.

Direct, active involvement in one’s professional community provides excellent opportunities for student engagement, scholarly work, and internships.<br/><br/>Position to be filled for the Spring 2024 semester.<br/><br/><strong>Workload<br/><br/></strong>12-month contract. Responsible to teach 24 units per year (typically 4 undergraduate courses per semester).<br/><br/><strong><u>About CCU<br/><br/></u></strong>Colorado Christian University is the premier interdenominational Christian university in Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region, delivering world class education to thousands of students. The fully accredited, nonprofit University is located in Lakewood, Colorado, a suburb of Denver.<br/><br/>Colorado Christian University was founded in 1914. CCU’s motto is "grace and truth," which comes from John 1.14: “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.” (ESV)<br/><br/>CCU's mission is Christ-centered higher education transforming students to impact the world with grace and truth. Colorado Christian University cultivates knowledge and love of God in a Christ-centered community of learners and scholars, with an enduring commitment to the integration of exemplary academics, spiritual formation, and engagement with the world. We envision graduates who think critically and creatively, lead with high ethical and professional standards, embody the character and compassion of Jesus Christ, treasure the gospel, and who thereby are prepared to impact the world in their callings.<br/><br/>CCU embraces an educational model that was there at the foundation of many of the great western and American universities. It is made up of three pillars—competence, character, and Christ-centered faith. Secular universities have abandoned two of those pillars. We think this is a major oversight that eventually undermines education. Furthermore, we believe this classical educational model is both life-giving and greatly needed in our time.<br/><br/>A leader in higher education, CCU has been consistently ranked in the top 2 percent of colleges and universities nationwide for its core curriculum by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni. CCU has had ten consecutive years of enrollment growth and has been named one of the five fastest-growing master’s granting universities by <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education.<br/><br/></em>CCU offers more than 200 degree program options for traditional and adult students through its two colleges--the College of Undergraduate Studies and College of Adult and Graduate Studies. More than 9,000 students attend the University on the main campus, in regional centers throughout Colorado, and online.<br/><br/><strong>What is most appealing about working at CCU?<br/></strong><ul><li>Faith-friendly: CCU’s culture is unique to higher education.
