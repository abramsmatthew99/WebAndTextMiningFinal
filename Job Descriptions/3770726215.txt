<strong>Overview<br/><br/></strong>PepsiCo’s strategy is to build capabilities that can enable us to become Faster, Stronger, and Better. Packaging can be a critical lever to enable this, by driving better consumer experiences and product liking, bringing cost opportunities to our bottom line, and integrating purpose into our business strategy through sustainable packaging. And more and more we have the need to deliver this right first time, and in the most timely and agile way. To do this effectively, we therefore need to transform the way we work, looking holistically at our end-to-end development processes, from design to market implementation. This will require us to move from more physical development and testing to a virtual development process, using the latest virtual design tools, data analytics, digital models, and prototyping capabilities.<br/><br/>The PepsiCo Global Beverages Packaging R&amp;D Advanced Engineering &amp; Design Team is leading the PepsiCo R&amp;D digital transformation for Beverage Packaging. With the vision of delivering winning products through digital innovation, this team develops breakthrough technologies centered around Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S), Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to deliver faster and better consumer centric innovated packaging and sustainable solutions.<br/><br/>Digital Analysis, AI/ML and Digital Twins, combined with smart, instrumented physical testing can accelerate packaging design, structures, and processes.
