<strong>Note:</strong> We hire interns throughout the year. Please let us know when you apply when you'll be available to start. We strongly prefer 12+ week internships.<br/><br/>We're a team of machine learning and product engineers training task-specific generative models with a focus on deep psychology. Our mission is to support everyone, everywhere, at any time, by building models that can perform modern therapy. We partner with organizations around the globe and power use cases AI-assisted crisis text response while securing best-in-class datasets to power our models.<br/><br/>Success to us means every human being in need of support having somewhere to go. We're a well-funded, seed-stage startup backed by top-tier tech investors involved in Docker, Shopify, Plaid, Notion, Canva, Opendoor, Twitch, Airtable, and others.<br/><br/>We're building a powerful team by empowering our engineers with the autonomy, flexibility, and resources to do their best work. We dream big and iterate fast. If that sounds like home, we'd love to hear from you.<br/><br/><strong>The Role<br/><br/></strong>As a machine learning intern, you’ll conduct applied research projects involving deep learning models from start to finish. You’ll work collaboratively with our ML engineers and take ownership of your own project. You’ll work at a faster pace than you have before while writing high-quality, production-ready code and producing meaningful scientific insights.<br/><br/>You’ll be primarily working with 5-100B parameter language models. You’ll be involved in data curation, supervised fine-tuning, RLHF/RLAIF/DPO, and making use of LLMs. You'll also work with real-time audio models, and orchestrating an ensemble of models to provide the best AI-native user experience. You’ll predominately be written in PyTorch, utilizing the modern tooling in the ML space, including some that we’ve developed in-house. We write high-quality, typed, Zen code.<br/><br/><strong>About you:<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>You’re either a PhD student, a Master’s students, or an exceptional undergraduate student</li><li>You have experience developing deep learning models in PyTorch, TensorFlow or JAX. </li><li>You also have experience with software engineering best practices and have a deep appreciation for what good code looks like</li><li>You're fast-paced and pragmatic. You'd rather prove out an idea through quick MVP code than present a slide deck to explain it. </li><li>You have a demonstrated track record of excellence, including coming up with new ideas or improving upon existing ideas, especially in machine learning</li><li>You understand why machine learning will bring about the greatest turning point in human history</li><li>Requirement: Able to work in New York City or London<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>What We Offer<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Competitive stipend</li><li>Hybrid environment, highly collaborative, fast-paced culture</li><li>Unparalleled growth opportunity - learn faster than you would anywhere else</li><li>Have a massive impact on the next generation of ML engineering</li><li>Work with a passionate team that cares about creating an AI world that's not winner-takes-all<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Values<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Bias towards Action</li><li>Authenticity - we keep it real and we say it like it is</li><li>Strong opinions, loosely held</li><li>We're nowhere near the end of history</li></ul>
