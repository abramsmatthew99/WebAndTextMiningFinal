        Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers, who pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.<br/><br/>The <em>Speaking the world into existence</em> research effort aims to apply the recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to prompt-based creation of interactive three-dimensional (3D) scenes. Integrating LLMs with a game engine should enable not only faster development of 3D content in various domains, such as gaming, mixed reality applications or animated films, but also allow for spontaneous user-generated content in the course of an interactive experience.<br/><br/>For this project, we aim to build a tool for rapid prototyping of games, by employing generative artificial intelligence (AI) to transmute natural language exchanges among humans and chatbots into dynamic narratives, non-player character (NPCs), and animated 3D game content. The strength of our approach lies in its capacity to blur the boundaries between game development and game play, positioning designers and players both as active collaborators within a sandbox game environment. With such a tool, they could craft worlds and establish rules, enriching their gaming experience by facilitating greater creative expression. While the primary target of this project is the creation of a prototyping tool, we expect that these techniques could be applied to the whole pipeline of creating interactive 3D content.<br/><br/>Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.<br/><br/><strong>Responsibilities<br/><br/></strong>Research Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, Research Interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Research Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, Research Interns are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other Research Interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.<br/><br/><strong>Qualifications<br/><br/></strong>Required Qualifications<br/><br/><ul><li>Currently enrolled in a PhD program in Computer Science or a related STEM field. Committed candidates enrolled in a master’s program might also be considered.</li><li>At least two years of research experience, including peer-reviewed publications, researching a topic closely related to the above description, such as AI systems for mixed reality, natural language processing, deep learning, generative models, mixed and virtual reality, multimodal interaction, etc.</li><li>At least one year of experience in building applications with the help of game engines, particularly Unity.<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Other Requirements<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Interns are expected to be physically located in their manager’s Microsoft worksite location for the duration of their internship.</li><li>In addition to the qualifications above, you’ll need to submit a minimum of two reference letters for this position. After you submit your application, a request for letters may be sent to your list of references on your behalf. Note that reference letters cannot be requested until after you have submitted your application, and furthermore, that they might not be automatically requested for all candidates. You may wish to alert your letter writers in advance, so they will be ready to submit your letter.<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Demonstrated ability to develop original research agendas.</li><li>Able to collaborate effectively with other researchers and product development teams.</li><li>Experience in applying multimodal machine learning in a real interactive system.</li><li>Experience programming multimodal systems that interact with users, particularly by integrating multiple machine-learned components such as computer vision, speech recognition, dialogue handling, natural language generation, etc.</li><li>Efficient interpersonal skills, cross-group, and cross-culture collaboration.</li><li>Ability to think unconventionally to derive creative and innovative solutions.<br/><br/></li></ul>The base pay range for this internship is - Applied Sciences IC2 : USD $5,090 -$10,120 per month. There is a different range applicable to specific work locations, with the San Francisco Bay area and New York City Metropolitan area, and the base pay range for this role in those locations is USD $6,690 -$11,030 per month.<br/><br/>The base pay range for this internship is- Applied Sciences IC3 : USD $6,290 -$12,170 per month. There is a different range applicable to specific work locations, within the San Francisco Bay area and New York City metropolitan area, and the base pay range for this role in those locations is USD $8,060 - $13, 240 per month.<br/><br/>Certain roles may be eligible for benefits and other compensation.
