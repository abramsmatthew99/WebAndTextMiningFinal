        HYBRID<br/><br/>Who we are: Groups360 is a booking engine for meeting space founded in 2014 by former Gaylord Entertainment executives Dave Kloeppel and Kemp Gallineau. Groups360 was created with a singular goal — to empower meeting planners by bringing innovation, transparency, and simplicity to the decades-old problem of booking groups. The company’s technology, GroupSyncTM, enables suppliers to distribute inventory, engage with planners, and optimize group revenue. GroupSync also equips planners to search and shop hotels worldwide and book rooms and space directly, online, or through a simplified RFP process. GroupSync is the first distribution channel to offer online booking for both group hotel rooms and meeting space. Groups360 has offices in Nashville, London, and Singapore.<br/><br/>Our Partners: In 2019, major hospitality players Accor, Hilton, IHG and Marriott, invested a combined $50 million in Groups360 to help fuel instant-booking development. In 2022, the world’s largest alternative asset manager Blackstone Innovations Partners, New York Hedge fund Fir Tree Partners, and property and technology investment firm, Zigg Capital invested a combined $35 million in Groups360 to help drive the industry wide transformation, making group travel simple.<br/><br/>Life at Groups360: Groups360 is an innovative, high-growth company with offices in Nashville, London and Singapore.
