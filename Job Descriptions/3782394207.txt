Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.<br/><br/>So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!<br/><br/><strong> #WeAreCisco</strong>
