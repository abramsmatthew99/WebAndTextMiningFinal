Volunteer work helps build critical competencies, knowledge, and skills and can provide valuable training and experience that translates directly to paid employment.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/><strong>Basic Education Requirement<br/><br/></strong><ul><li> Degree: Engineering. To be acceptable, the program must:</li><li> lead to a bachelor's degree in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by ABET; or</li><li> include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics;<br/><br/></li></ul>OR<br/><br/><ul><li> Combination of education and experience -- college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished</li><li> a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and</li><li> a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering.<br/><br/></li></ul>The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following:<br/><br/><ul><li> Professional registration or licensure -- Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT)1, or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.</li><li> Written Test -- Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) 2 examination or any other written test required for professional registration by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico</li><li> Specified academic courses -- Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in the basic requirements under paragraph A.
