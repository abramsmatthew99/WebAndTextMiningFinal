Candidates MUST either hold a New Jersey Department of Education CE, CEAS or Standard Certificate in Technology Education or Technology Related Field (we would consider a few different certifications issued but the NJDOE). We can consider a K-6 Elementary Certification for the Elementary Technology Vacancy only. If you are certified in another state, you may still apply while you are seeking reciprocity certification (which can be done on the NJ Department of Education website), but please flag this for us during your initial interview. Please do not apply if you are neither certified in New Jersey nor actively in process of obtaining certification.
